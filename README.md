# Work-Day-Scheduler


## Application

A work schedule whereby a user can track their tasks for the day. The user inputs tasks ordered by time. A colour scheme will tell the user when the time is present (red) upcoming (green) or past(grey). Their tasks will remain in the text area if they have saved using the button. If the page is reloaded their tasks will remain until they delete them.

## Challenges

I chose violence when I started this task. I had copied the bootstrap column and rows wrong, setting everything on sperate grids which was making the CSS impossible to apply!
Then I didnt consider that 24hour time was going to be an important factor in this so I had everything set to run in standard time - which again was making most of my functions impossible to run.
I learnt the hard way the JS can we tricky in that it will parseInt numbers and letters together, instead of throwing an error because of the letters (ex. I was parseInt-ing 10am which was throwing the whole schedule out of whack!)

## Learnings

Something that stood out to me with this project was the idea I had that it was "easy" - which made me take a laxed approach and caused me to make these silly mistakes - I have been learning this stuff for only 6 weeks, I shouldnt consider any of it easy and be taking it for granted!
